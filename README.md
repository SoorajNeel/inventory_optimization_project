# Inventory Optimization Analysis

## 🧠 Objective
Analyze raw-material procurement and consumption to reduce procurement costs and improve inventory efficiency for the business.

## 🚀 One-line summary
Identified overstock drivers, proposed revised reorder policies, and built an interactive Power BI dashboard to help procurement teams reduce excess stock and improve cash flow.

## 🔎 Key findings
- Identified overstock items resulting in **₹\<amount\>** in excess carrying cost (replace `\<amount\>` with the calculated value).
- Proposed changes to reorder points and lot sizes that can reduce overstock risk while maintaining service levels.
- Forecasted consumption trends using historical data to inform ordering frequency and safety stock.
